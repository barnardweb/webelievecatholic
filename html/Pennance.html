    This section will cover two of the seven sacraments, called Reconciliation (or Penance) and Anointing of the Sick.  These are the sacraments of healing, meant to unite us to Christ through the healing of our spiritual wounds.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1><b>Reconciliation</b></h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p1> The Sacrament of Reconciliation, also known as Penance or Confession, is the first of these sacraments of healing.  This Sacrament is where an individual confesses their sins to a Catholic Priest, who offers forgiveness and absolution of sins, through the power of Jesus Christ.  The purpose of this Sacrament is twofold, first it gives us an opportunity to submit ourselves to Christ, and second it offers us a chance to be healed through Christ’s Mercy.  Once confession is complete a person is forgiven of all their Mortal and Venial Sins, and is able to begin healing through the Mercy of Christ.</p1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p2>The Sacrament of Confession is vital for a Catholic's lifelong journey for sanctification.  Just as the waters of Baptism wash away our sins at the time, Confession also cleanses us of our sins through God’s infinite Mercy, and allows us to continue to purify ourselves in the Lord.  We purify ourselves through an act of humility and a blessing of God’s Grace As St. John Paul II said </p2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p3><i><centre> “Penance, by its nature,” he explained, “involves purification, in both the acts of the penitent who lays bare his conscience because of the deep need to be pardoned and reborn, and in the effusion of sacramental grace that purifies and renews.” </centre></i></p3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p4>The ritual typically takes place in a confessional booth or private room.  It begins with a private examination of conscience outside the booth/room.  In this moment a person takes time to recall their sins, and gather any other thoughts they want to take into the confessional.  Once they are ready they will enter the room.  Then, the person starts by asking for God’s blessing, and identifying their sins.  After this the confessor (a priest or bishop typically) will offer some spiritual counsel, prescribe a penance, and have the person recite an Act of Contrition.  Upon the conclusion of the Act, the priest will say a prayer of absolution and dismiss the individual, who will then conduct their penance as required and begin their life anew!</p4>

      <h2><b>Anointing of the Sick </b></h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p5>Anointing of the Sick is the second sacrament of healing, it is designed to bring spiritual and physical strength to a person with an extreme illness, or near death.  Often referred to as Last Rites, this sacrament is not limited to those who are near death, but it is reserved for all who have an extreme illness (physical, mental or spiritual).  This sacrament reflects Jesus’ time on Earth when he healed many from their physical and spiritual ailments, and in modern day the priest acts through Christ to perform the same healings, just like the apostles.</p5>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p6>For those who are healed or recover, they are permitted to receive the sacrament again, if they should ever encounter a life-threatening illness again.  The sacrament is also allowed prior to a serious medical procedure, and as noted above, the sacrament is also done near the end of one's life.  It is often paired with the Sacrament of Confession and the Eucharist when it is possible.</p6>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p7>The act is very simple, there is a series of prayers said by the priest, and then the individual is anointed with a special Chrism oil that has been blessed at the previous Holy Thursday Mass.  This oil is then applied to the individual's forehead, just like at Baptism, as a symbol of healing and also draws a connection to one’s initiation into the Church.  Below is a video that details Last Rites:</p7>
