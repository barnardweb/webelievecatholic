    There’s a lot of talk about how Jesus saved Humanity, and we refer to Jesus as our savior; but what exactly is that story of salvation?
    <br>
    <br> 
    The story of salvation begins with God's creation of the world and the original harmony between God and humanity. However, in the fall of man, Adam and Eve’s disobedience led to the introduction of sin and brokenness into the world. In response to this, God initiated a plan of salvation to restore humanity's relationship with Him.
    <br>
    <br> 
    Throughout the Old Testament, God revealed Himself to humanity, forming covenants with individuals like Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David. These covenants were stepping stones in God's plan to bring salvation to all people.  The story of salvation starts with the Fall of Man, but through Noah, Abraham, Moses and David, God establishes a relationship with the people of Israel, his chosen people.  It is through Israel that God will save the world.
    <br>
    <br> 
    The culmination of God's plan came with the birth of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Jesus, fully divine and fully human, lived a sinless life and preached the message of God's love, mercy, and forgiveness. Through His sacrificial death on the cross, Jesus offered Himself as the ultimate sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins.
    <br>
    <br> 
    Following His death, Jesus rose from the dead, conquering sin and death. His resurrection is the source of hope and eternal life for all who believe in Him. Through faith in Jesus, baptism, and participation in the sacraments, individuals are incorporated into the Body of Christ, the Church.
    <br>
    <br> 
    As for today, the Catholic Church, guided by the Holy Spirit, continues Jesus' mission of spreading the Gospel and administering the sacraments. Salvation is a lifelong journey of faith, marked by repentance, receiving God's grace, and striving for holiness. At the end of time, there will be a final judgment, where God will gather all people and establish His eternal kingdom of justice, love, and peace.
