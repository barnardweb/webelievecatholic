    One of the central points of the Catholic Faith is the Divine Revelation.  The Divine Revelation highlights the belief that God has communicated Himself to humanity through various means. Divine Revelation is seen as a gradual and progressive process, culminating in the person of Jesus Christ.
    <br>
    <br>
    God desires a personal relationship with His creation, and because of this, He initiates communication with humanity. This communication unfolds through Scripture (the Bible) and Sacred Tradition, which together form a single Deposit of Faith. The Catholic Church, guided by the Holy Spirit, is entrusted with the interpretation and transmission of this revelation.
    <br>
    <br>
    God's revelation is conveyed in a manner suitable to human understanding and cultural contexts, by using symbols, narratives, and historical events. Faith is absolutely critical in receiving and accepting this revelation, because Godâ€™s revelation surpasses human reason (but is not contrary to it).
    <br>
    <br>
    The pinnacle of Divine Revelation is Jesus Christ, the Word of God made flesh. Through His life, teachings, death, and resurrection, He fully reveals the Father's love and plan for humanity's salvation. Jesus entrusted His teachings to the Apostles, who, in turn, passed them down through apostolic succession and the Magisterium (the teaching authority of the Church).
    <br>
    <br>
    The Catholic Church teaches that the Divine Revelation is complete in Christ, and nothing further will be added until His second coming. However, the Church's ongoing reflection and understanding of this revelation continue to deepen and unfold over time.
    <br>
    <br>
    To conclude, Divine Revelation explains how God has communicated Himself to humanity through Scripture, Tradition, and the person of Jesus Christ. It emphasizes the role of faith, the Church's responsibility in safeguarding and interpreting revelation, and the completeness of Divine Revelation in Christ.
