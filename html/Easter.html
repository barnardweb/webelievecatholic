    The Easter Season is a period of fifty days beginning on Easter Sunday and ending at Pentecost.  It is the penultimate time of the year for Catholics.  This season is where we celebrate the Resurrection of Christ and his time on Earth before His ascension into Heaven.  In addition to these 50 days, from the end of Lent (Holy Thursday) through Easter Sunday is a period of time known as the Easter Triduum.

      <h1><b>Easter Triduum</b></h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p1>From Holy Thursday through Easter Vigil Mass on Saturday Evening, the Church is in a time called the Easter Triduum.  This time period focuses on the final days of Christ, into his time that he is buried in the tomb before he is resurrected on Easter Sunday.  Holy Thursday focuses on the Last Supper, where Christ instituted the Eucharist and broke bread with his apostles.  Good Friday focuses on the Passion narrative, where Jesus was arrested, sentenced to death and crucified.  Traditionally, Catholics will celebrate these days by doing a Holy Thursday evening Mass and a Communion Service on Good Friday (No Mass is celebrated on Good Friday).  On Saturday the Church begins the Easter Vigil, which is the most important Mass of the Liturgical Year.</p1>

      <h2><b>Easter Vigil Mass</b></h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p3>The Easter Vigil Mass is considered the holiest of Solemnities in the entire Catholic Church.  It is the first celebration of Christ’s Resurrection every year.  It’s the turning point in the Triduum, on Thursday and Friday the reflections are of great sorrow for the trials and tribulations Christ endures.  However, the Easter Vigil Mass is where those reflections change to great joy and focus on the glory of God.  It marks Christ’s passage from death into new life.  The totality of the Vigil Mass cannot be unearthed here (the video below provides more explanation), but another key element of the Vigil Mass is the Liturgy of Baptism that takes place.  This is where all those who have been preparing to join the Church will receive their Baptism and be initiated into the Catholic Church (typically the culmination of an RCIA program).</p3><br>

      <h3><b>Octave of Easter </b></h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p8>The Octave of Easter begins on Easter Sunday.  The story of Christ’s resurrection is celebrated for 8 days.  During this time, all days are treated like a solemnity, they are times for feasts, worship and celebration.  They are not a time for penance or penitential offerings.  The Octave of Easter ends on the first Sunday after Easter, which is also known as Divine Mercy Sunday.  Divine Mercy Sunday is a day where Catholics celebrate the infinite and endless mercy of Jesus Christ, through his passion and death for us.  This feast day typically coincides with the Divine Mercy Devotion.</p8>

      <br>
      <h3><b>Remainder of Easter Season </b></h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p8>The remainder of the Easter Season runs from Divine Mercy Sunday until Pentecost.  This is a time where Catholics meditate on the miracle of His resurrection, the actions he made during his time on Earth where he was resurrected, and then to reflect on his ascension into Heaven.  The Easter Season ends on Pentecost, which is the celebration of when the Holy Spirit descended upon the 12 apostles of Christ, giving them the graces they needed to “go forth and baptize all nations”.  It was the birth of the Church.</p8>
