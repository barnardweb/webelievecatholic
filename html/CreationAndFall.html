    The Creation Narrative can be found at the beginning of the Bible in the book of Genesis. God is the creator of the universe and all that exists. In Seven days, he brought forth the world and everything in it out of nothing and declared it to be good.  The pinnacle of God's creation was humanity, created in His own image and likeness. God created the first Man, Adam and then the first woman Eve and placed them in the Garden of Eden; where they enjoyed a state of original holiness and justice, living in harmony with God and creation.
    <br>
    <br>
However, Adam and Eve, tempted by the serpent, disobeyed God's command and fell into sin. This event, known as the Fall, had profound consequences for all of humanity. Original sin entered the world, affecting human nature and leading to a rupture in the relationship between God and humanity. As a result, all human beings are born with a wounded nature inclined toward sin and separated from God's divine life.
<br>
    <br>
The consequences of the Fall include suffering, death, and a weakened human will prone to moral and spiritual struggles. However, the Church also teaches that God did not abandon humanity. In His mercy and love, God promised a Redeemer who would restore humanity's relationship with Him.  As youâ€™ll see later, this Redeemer is Jesus Christ.
<br>
    <br>
In summary, God created the world and humanity in a state of goodness and harmony. However, the Fall introduced sin and its consequences into the world, leading to a rupture in the relationship between God and humanity. Yet, through Jesus Christ, God offers the hope of redemption and restoration for all who believe in Him.
