        This section is designed for those who are not familiar with the Roman Catholic Church. Modeled after the "RCIA" programs (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults), this section will guide readers through 4 main topics that cover a lot of the basis of Catholicism.  For those currently enrolled in an RCIA program, this page is meant to supplement, not replace, the education provided by those programs.  
    
        <h1><b>What We Believe</b></h1>
        <p1> This section discusses some of the tenants of the Catholic Faith.  The fundamental belief that Man has in his Creator, the divinity of God and Jesus, the Holy Trinity and more.  Most of these tenets can be further explored in the beginning of the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC), but here we will look at these topics from an introductory standpoint.  There is a lot of heavy and dense material here, the goal is to provide an introduction to these  topics, which can be expounded upon in other texts.
        </p1>
        <h2><b>The Mass & the Sacraments</b></h2>
        <p2> This section will go into detail about the Catholic Mass.  What it symbolizes, why it's important to Catholics, the Order of the Mass and much more.  If you are curious about visiting a Church  or attending a service, this can be a good precursor to help you understand more about it.  In addition to the Mass, this section will cover the 7 Sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church.   These Sacraments are physical manifestations of God's Grace, and provide Catholics with an  opportunity where the physical world meets the spiritual world.
        </p2>
        <h3><b>Catholic Teaching</b></h3>
        <p3> This section will get into the "rules" of the Church.  There are many different precepts, orders, recommendations and requirements that can get very confusing and overwhelming.  This section will discuss the foundation for these teachings; not only what Catholics believe but why they believe them.  This section will stick strictly to the authority of the Magisterium when discussing teachings.  With such an exhaustive list, there are many discussions and interpretations that naturally come.  Such things are allowed, with reason (explained later), but the Church Magisterium holds the final authority on Catholic teaching.
        </p3>
        <h4><b>Catholic Living</b></h4>
        <p4> This section will discuss what it's like to live as Catholics.  Catholics have a rich tradition and countless numbers of prayers and devotions.  In this section you will find discussions about these devotions, how Catholics pray, the Saints and Mary, the Mother of Jesus Christ, and the liturgical calendar.  In addition, there is a section about the Easter season, one of the most important celebrations in the Catholic Faith.
